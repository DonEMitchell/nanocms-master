   <h2>Menu builder</h2>
   <p>With this tweak you can build menu based on categories.
   Only one level is possible because there is not (yet?) sub categories in NanoCMS.</p>
   <p>To add a menu, click on "Add" button. To delete a menu, juste delete the content of "caption" and save.</p>
   <p>In template file, add <code>&lt;?php runTweak('menu-show'); ?&gt;</code> where you want
   a menu.</p>
